44Appendix A
Rating High (3) Medium (2) Low (1)
DDamage
potentialCan subvert all
security controls
and get full trust
to take over the
whole IoT
ecosystem.Could leak
sensitive
information.Could leak
sensitive
information.
RReproducibility The attack is
always
reproducible.The attack can
be reproduced
only within a
timed window or
specific
condition.It's very dif ficult
to reproduce the
attack, even with
specific
information
about the
vulnerability .
EExploitability A novice
attacker could
execute the
exploit.A skilled
attacker could
make the attack
repeatedly .Allows a skilled
attacker with
in-depth
knowledge to
perform the
attack.
AAffected users All users, default
configurations,
all devices.Affects some
users, some
devices, and
custom
configurations.Affects a small
percentage of
users and/or
devices through
an obscure
feature.
DDiscoverability Attack
explanation can
be easily found
in a publication.Affects a
seldom-used
feature where an
attacker would
need to be very
creative to
discover a
malicious use for
it.Is obscure and
unlikely an
attacker would
discover a way
to exploit the
bug.
