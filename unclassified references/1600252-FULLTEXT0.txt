Estimated results for a random
recommender system
Forsimulatingtheresultsforasystemrecommendingrandomtracksfromthe
catalog, the following numbers were used:
•Number of relevant tracks per playlist: 30
(the average playlist had ~100 tracks, and 30% of them were in the
hidden section of the playlist).
•Number of playlists: 9000 (the number of test set playlists)
•Numberofiterations: 100(howmanytimesthesimulationwasrunper
k)
Following is the source code for the simulation, and the average recall@10 ,
precision@10 ,recall@500 , andprecision@500 for the simulated random
recommender.
