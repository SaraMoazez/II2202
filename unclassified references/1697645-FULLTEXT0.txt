As
mentioned
earlier ,
the
learning
time
decreased
by
five
days
from
SDA
4-5
(without
QBL)
to
SDA
6-9
(with
QBL).
However ,
there
is
limited
insight
into
the
actual
amount
of
time
the
students
spent
on
studying
during
the
different
course
offerings.
Time
on
task
is
essential
for
learning
and
might
have
an
impact
on
a
student's
self-assessed
confidence.
